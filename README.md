<i>Earlier icons can be found in the [OpenCanopyIcons-CC0 Repository](https://github.com/blackosx/OpenCanopyIcons-CC0).</i>

# OpenCanopyIcons
This repository contains sets of individual icons intended for use with the OpenCanopy GUI frontend for [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).
The files are in Apple .icns file format and contain only images sized 128x128px and 256x256px.

The idea is that a user can choose to select one or more icons from this collection to enhance their GUI experience. They can either replace images that are already in their OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory, renaming the icons from here with the same name, or rename the icon from here as .VolumeIcon.icns and place at the root of the volume as a hidden file, and adjusting the PickerAttributes in config.plist accordingly.

Please note that these are not complete sets of images that can be directly used in OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory. 

For details about how to use these then please consult the [OpenCore configuration documentation PDF](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf).
