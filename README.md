# OpenCanopyIcons
This repository contains sets of individual icons intended for use with the OpenCanopy GUI frontend for [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).
The files are in Apple .icns file format and contain only images sized 128x128px and 256x256px.

The idea is that a user can choose to select one or more icons from this collection to enhance their GUI experience. They can either replace images that are already in their OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory, renaming the icons from here with the same name, or rename the icon from here as .VolumeIcon.icns and place at the root of the volume as a hidden file, and adjusting the PickerAttributes in config.plist accordingly.

Please note that these are not complete sets of images that can be directly used in OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory. 

For details about how to use these then please consult the [OpenCore configuration documentation PDF](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf).

## License

Set1 and Set2 are released under the CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) license to dedicate the work to the public domain so those directories each include that license file.

Set3 onwards do not pertain to any license which I therefore understand means it's under exclusive copyright by default. [More Details](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)
